# Academic writing techniques

Load when use case is **`academic`**, or user asks for paper, abstract, thesis section, literature summary. All languages.

**Boundary:** this skill helps *write* academic prose structure — not peer-review critique (see `peer-review` use case separately).

## Sentence 1 job

Contribution, claim, or recommendation — not flattery opener.

## Section order (typical)

1. **Contribution / thesis** — what this work adds
2. **Evidence** — methods, results (user-supplied)
3. **Limitations** — honest scope
4. **Conclusion / recommendation** — if requested

## Register

Default `baku`. No Farhan slang, marketing superlatives, or chat particles unless user quoted them.

## Cross-language rules

- Citations and bibliography format: follow user/journal — do not invent references
- Passive voice OK where discipline expects it; still prefer clear agent when possible
- Technical terms: discipline-standard; protected symbols unchanged
- No fabricated p-values, sample sizes, or author names

Other languages: follow [languages/<id>/pack.md](../languages/) `register: baku` examples.
