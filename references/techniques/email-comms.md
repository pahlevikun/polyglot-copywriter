# Email communications techniques

Load when use case is **`email`**, **`letter`**, or **`announcement`**. Works with any language — apply structure here, phrasing from active **language pack** + **locale technique** if present.

## Structure (all languages)

1. **Subject / line 1** — answer, ask, or decision (not warmup)
2. **Need-to-know** — who, when, where, link (1–3 sentences max)
3. **Next step** — one action, owner, deadline if exists
4. **Stop** — no recap, no empty "let me know if you have questions"

Full layout patterns: [plain-comms.md](../usecases/plain-comms.md). Calque avoidance: [natural-writing.md](natural-writing.md).

## Register

Default `profesional` for email use case. `santai` only when user or thread tone is clearly casual. `baku` for formal letters on request.

## Cross-language rules

- Complete sentences — no telegram fragments in email body
- Protected artifacts (commands, paths, ticket IDs) unchanged
- Timezone on deadlines (`Fri 19 Sep, 14:00 WIB`)
- One thread = one primary ask

## Locale routing

After this file, load locale technique when `language` matches:
